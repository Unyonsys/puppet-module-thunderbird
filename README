Thunderbird
=======

This module configures Thunderbird for autoconfig.
Basically, it makes Thunderbird look for a config file at startup, which itself refers to 
the URI of the actual confif file.
More info on autoconfig can be found at http://mit.edu/~thunderbird/www/maintainers/autoconfig.html

Note: At the moment we skip Thunderbird install by the standard package resource, because we want to stick
with 3.1 (for use with SOGo), and the package installs thunderbird-global-menu which leads to a lot of
unwanted dependencies.
